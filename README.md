# Overview of Lab 1 Section 4.4

I implemented a real-time color information display. The instant color intensity of R, G, B and C will be displayed. The APDS 9960 picks up the lighting and sends the R, G, B and C values to the RP 2040 where it utilized the HID to display these information on the screen. From the demo video (44_demo.gif) it can be seen that the readings for R, G, B and C change with the lighting condition.
