# Overview of Lab 1 Section 4.4

I implemented a real-time color information display. The instant color intensity of R, G, B and C will be displayed. The APDS 9960 picks up the lighting and sends the R, G, B and C values to the RP 2040 where it utilized the HID to display these information on the screen. From the demo video (44_demo.gif) it can be seen that the readings for R, G, B and C change with the lighting condition.

Below is an illustrative figure of the general structure of the embedded system. Dipicted in purple represents the lighting. Arrowed lines in both directions represent the communication protocol between the two devices. For example, for communicating between APDS9960 and RP2040, I2C protocol is implemented.
